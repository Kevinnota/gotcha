## parameters tweaking

---

Here are all the parameter for the designing the baits

- ```-fl``` or ```--filter_len``` specifies the minimum nucleotides length to keep a sequence. 
While the default is 100, it can be helpfull to haigher the treshold to include only complete sequences.


- ```-cl``` or ```--collapse``` is the percent identity to collapse sequences. The defeault is 1, 
so that only identical sequences will be collapsed. This parameter can be useful when trying 
to create baits bases on a very large number of sequences derived from closely related taxa.
While lowering this treshold is expected to have similar results to the ```--distance``` 
parameter, collapsing the sequences will substantiall fasten downstream steps.


- ```-bl``` or ```--baitlength```       lenght of the bait sequences - defeault is 80


- ```-tl``` or ```--tiling```           kmer tiling for ancestral node selection - default is 10


- ```-ds``` or ```--distance```         maximal distance to the ancestral node - defeault is 0.09


- ```-so``` or ```--trim_seqoverlap``` specifies the trimal parameter for the minimum overlap 
of positions with other positions in each MSA column to be considered a "good position". 
The param between 0 and 100 - if not specified will skip


- ```-ro``` or ```--trim_resoverlap```  specifies the trimal parameter for the minimum percentage 
of "good positions" that a sequence must have in order to be conserved. 
Param between 1 and 0 - if not specified will skip.


- ```-fs``` or ```--fast``` performs the fast baits search w/out tree inference and ancestral state reconstruction. Yet,
it will keep all preprocessing steps. This approach can be sensible when dealing with a very large amount of sequences with a highly complete
taxon sampling.


- ```-dt``` or ```--dust_threshold``` is the score threshold for low complexity region masking - default is 1.

Some additional methodological recommendations:

- use only shallow taxonomy for ITS

- check the alignment
