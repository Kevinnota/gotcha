## Install dependencies


gotcha consists of a python script and most of its dependencies can be conveniently installed through conda.


---
The most straightforward way to install gotcha is by using the gotcha_env.yaml. This will install automatically all dependencies in the gotcha environment so that the script can work without a problem.

```
mamba env create -f gotcha_env.yaml
```
or
```
conda env create -f gotcha_env.yaml
```
